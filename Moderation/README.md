# Moderation commands (+ custom logging)
Fully functioning custom moderation DM and logging commands that DM the user an embed with their mod action information and logs the command in the modlog channel.

## Features

<hr>

## Other Info
These commands **are not** standalone. You need to add them all to use them without error.

Also, please note that; It would be best to stop the default logs from being sent. Or else you will have 2 logs being sent in your modlogs.
