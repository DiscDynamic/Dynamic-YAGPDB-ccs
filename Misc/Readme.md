# Mischallaneous commands
Mischallaneous commands I've made that go nowhere else

## Features
- Not much

## Usage

`-Modmyself` - Actions a random moderation command on the user who triggered the command. Also sends the general info in their DMs and in modlog

`-revive` - Sends an small boring embed that is supposed to revive the chat when dead.

`-Confess <Confession>` - Creates an annoymous confession, logs to a staff channel with an "encrypted" UserID (Basic "encryption" using regex)

`-Decrypt <Key>` - Decrypts the encrypted UserID fron the confession command to form a UserID 

## Other Info
These commands may or may not be standalone.
