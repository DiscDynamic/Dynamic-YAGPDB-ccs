# Mischallaneous commands
Mischallaneous commands I've made that go nowhere else

## Features
- Not much (yet)

## Usage

`-Modmyself` - Actions a random moderation command on the user who triggered the command. Also sends the general info in your DMs and in modlog (won't include images)


`-revive` - Sends an small boring embed that is supposed to revive the chat when dead.

`-Confess <Confession>` - Creates an annoymous confession, logs to a staff channel with an "encrypted" UserID (Basic "encryption")

`-Decrypt <Key>` - Decrypts the encrypted UserID fron the confession command to form a UserID 

## Other Info
These commands may or may not be standalone.

These commands do not feature any images in this Readme since these are misc commands that don't need doucmenting like my others
