## What is the plugin system
The plugin system is a curated list of addons/extra's that have been designed and made to enhance the features that the base economy system provides within a single file/CustomCommand.

## Why use plugins
As mentioned above the plugin system is designed to better enhance the base economy system. This might be providing new ways for users to interact, additonal ways for users to generate money or other.

## Other/Important information
- Contrary to the base system, none of the plugins require additonal files. They are optional singular files.
- Plugins can be removed at whims and the base system is **not** dependent on any of them.
- Extra information regarding each plugin can be found within their respective folder.
