> # :warning: **Migrating from V6.6 to V7**   
V7 comes with a change in how per-user values are stored.  
Please use the [transfer command](transfer.cc.go) to migrate *your own* data to the new system.  
It will take time before other users have moved their data over and this cannot be automated without bypassing limits.
Please note that <b><i>ALL</i></b> commands will need updating, and I reccomend running the `set` command again to ensure all the new databases are initialized.

# Economy CCs V7

## Other Info

Plugins are (OPTIONAL) addons to the Economy system that work to enhance your experience. These can be added and removed on your own whims.
