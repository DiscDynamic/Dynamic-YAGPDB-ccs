# Notice
These custom commands are being devloped using YAGPDB functions
However are being tested using a selfhosted instance with an increased char limit
As such, some of these commands may be larger than the character limit.
I will at the latest, by V4 shorten these down, so that they can all fit.
**Thanks!**

# Important
Settings commands found <a href="https://github.com/Ranger-4297/YAGPDB-ccs/tree/main/Economy/V2/Settings">here</a> are not currently role-locked and are able to be used by all.
Untill I add an inbuilt role-block, I suggest you lock the command in the cc settings
