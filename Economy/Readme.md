# Economy CCs
Fully functional basic economy system that for your server!

## Features
- Basic economy
- Easy to read embeds
- Customizability

## Usage

`Work`, `Crime`, `Rob`, `Deposit`, `Withdrawl`, `Bal`, `setFailRate`, `setMax`, `setMin`, `setSymbol` and more to come!

## Other Info
These commands **are not** standalone. You must add them all to use them.

## N.B: Will not currently work since the setup command hasn't been added
> To set it up yourself just execute the following custom command
`{{dbSet 0 "EconomySettings" (sdict "min" 200 "max" 500 "failRate" 20 "economtSymbol" "Â£" "startBalance" 200)}}`
> I'm hoping to make 1 `set` command that can handle all settings arguments in the future, but there's no ETA
