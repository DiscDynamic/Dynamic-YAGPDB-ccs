# Staff commandss

## Features
- Break, announce, event commands

## Usage

`-Announce [Announcement]` - Sends an embed with information about an announcement, including who sent it (see image (Keep in mind, I don't have the ping role, and the announcement will go to your announcement channel.)).

`-Break <time>` - Removes the staff role so you can go on a break (for a duration specified by you) (No idea how to show this in an image--unable to screenrecord).

## Other Info
These commands **are** standalone. You are able to use them without each other, it is not required that they are used together.
These were only for basic stuff, not going to be working on them at all
