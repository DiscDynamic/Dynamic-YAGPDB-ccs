# Join & leave logs
Featureful embeds for logging joins and leaves

## Features
- Leave and join logging
- Clear embeds
- Simple to read logs

## Usage
**These aren't commands per-se, so you can't trigger them like a normal command**

`Join message in channel` - Sends an embed with information about a user in the join log, including who their UserID and more and the public join notify.

`Leave message` - Sends an embed with information about a user in the join log, including who their UserID and more (see image 1) and the public leave notify.

## Other Info

When adding the commands, make sure to set the channel they run on your welcome/leave or respective channels. NOT the log channel.

These commands **are** standalone. You are able to use them without each other, it is not required that they are used together. However it would look more organized.
