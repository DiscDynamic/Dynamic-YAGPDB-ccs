<h1>What's this?</h1>

So, a fair few people know that in the last week I spent my time setting up a <a href="https://rhykerw.com">website</a> for myself. Along with this I've set up an API to use with YAGPDB CC

<h2>API</h2>

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Ranger-4297/rhykerw.com#API) for whatever API('s) I currently have built.

Example of how to use them within yag can be seen within the individual files named after the URL endpoint.
